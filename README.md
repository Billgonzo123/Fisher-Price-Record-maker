## Description
Are you a person who owns and loves your retro Fisher Price Record Player Music Box? If so, this is the app for you. This was an idea I had that fortunately someone else came up with and executed.  
The SCAD file generated by this program was taken from Fred's Fisher Price Record Creator. Thanks Fred for all your hard work.

 Fred's UI for writing/transposing songs is very bare bones and can be a little annoying to deal with. So I created this app to make my life easier and hopefully someone out there will also appreciate it!
 
 ## Features
 - Write songs in a sequencer-like environment!
 - Watch your record generate and spin in real time
 - Download your SCAD file for 3D printing
 - Save/Load your song as a file that will also work with Fred' Fisher Price Record Creator
 
 ## Usage
 - Follow this [link](https://billgonzo123.github.io/Fisher-Price-Record-maker/) to start
- Select the number of total beats you need. It takes 25 seconds for the record to spin around once, so the tempo of your song is bound by how many beats you use.
- Use the mouse to turn on or off beats for each note as needed
- Press ```Play/Stop``` to listen to what your song sounds like
- The ```X``` above each column will clear all notes for that column
- The ```-``` or ```+``` buttons at the bottom of a selected column to remove the column or insert a new column at that location.
- Click ```Download SCAD File``` and open the file in a piece of software like OpenSCAD
- After opening the SCAD file in OpenSCAD, press F6 and wait for your record to render
- The STL file generated is what you can use to 3D print your creation!
- The save buttons will save a ```.fpr``` file wich can be loaded again with the load button. This file is compatable with Fred's Fisher Price Record Creator


Thanks again to Fred for your SCAD file, which I used as a template!
